WhileLoopVatTemp
================

This simple program demonstrates the while loop. It will prompt a user to enter a temperature. If that temperature exceeds 102.5 degrees C, it will inform the user to check the temperature again in 5 minutes and prompt the user again for a temperature. This will loop until the temperature does not exceed 102.5 degrees C.  Once the temperature does not exceed 102.5 degrees C, the user will be informed to check the temperature every 15 minutes.
